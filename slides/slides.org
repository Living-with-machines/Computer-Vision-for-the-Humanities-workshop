#+TITLE:    Introduction to Computer Vision for Humanities Research
#+AUTHOR:    Daniel van Strien
#+EMAIL:     daniel.van-strien@bl.uk


* Aims
- Introduce computer vision methods for classifying images using deep learning
- Show some example uses of computer vision in Digital Humanities/GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums) setting
- The process of training a model
- Thinking about labels
- Give a starting point for exploring the topic

* Disclaimer

- You will not know computer vision by the end of this session
- The course uses Python but it is not necessary to follow every step of the code
- The course is a work in progress, any feedback on how useful it is (or not) would be hugely helpful
- The lesson from which this material is derived is under review and likely to change
- Some of the materials were developed in the context of Living with Machines


* Computer vision

"Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do." -- [[wikipedia:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision][Wikipedia]]


* Machine learning

"Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data." -- [[wikipedia:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning][Wikipedia]]


* Deep learning

"Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning." -- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning][Wikipedia]]

* Computer vision for humanities

Optical Character Recognition:
- Process of turning images of text into machine readable text
- Often the only feasible way for turning large amounts of digitised material into machine readable text.
