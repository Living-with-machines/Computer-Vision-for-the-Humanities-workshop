# Day 2: Doing a computer vision project

##  Aims:

- The goal today is to go through ~~all~~ many of the steps of doing a computer vision project focused on a humanities research question.
- Tis day will be less structured than day one and may change depending on the interests of participants.
- We ~~will~~ may end up with:
  - a training dataset
  - a trained model


##  What does a computer vision project look like?

###  What is our question?

To explore some of the steps involved in creating a computer vision project we will make up a research question/topic:

> How does the number of people appearing in photographs change over time in (mostly) US newspapers?

### Do we need to use machine learning?

### Do we need to create a model?

- using commercial services?
- model hubs
- finding existing models.
- test an existing model?

### Creating training data (simple approach)

This is often seen as the most boring part of machine learning but it's both important and potentially an interesting and challenging area to explore.
